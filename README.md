# EMG_envelope
Algorithm for the automatic estimation of the RMS envelope of the surface electromyography signal.

## Description

This package contains the MATLAB codes for implementing the algorithm described in:

S.Ranaldi, C. De Marchis and S. Conforto "An automatic, adaptive, information-based method for the extraction of the sEMG envelope"

This package contains some mex function to speed up the algorithm using C functions.
